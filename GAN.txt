GAN 
GENERATIVE ADVERSIAL NEURAL NETWORK used to generate new images 

1) Setting up the environment 
2) Building a Datapipeline 
3) Creating a generator and dicriminator 
4) Building a custom Training Loop
5) generating new images

Steps involved are :
1) Load the data from Tensor flow data set 
2) Build the Generator Model (FOOC the descriminator) 
3) Build discriminator Model(picks up fake) in the form of binary 0 and 1 0 reperesents true and 1 represents fake
4) Training the model
